The entire assignment needs to be pushed as a GitHub repo and shared with us

● Try to document the frontend alongside the code
● You don’t have any particular rule for structuring the frontend but the more sensible the
structure is according to the task, the better
● Try to make the commits as atomic as possible




Assignment Description
You are required to create a frontend for a block explorer similar to https://etherscan.io/.
Although we don’t want you to add all the feature sets of etherscan, we expect the following
things to be there:

● Header with ether price and gas price (in terms of gwei)
● Search bar where the user can search for a particular address, transaction hash or token
● Getting details of a particular address which includes
- ether balance of that address
- list of normal transactions (using pagination)
- list of erc-20 token transfers
For tokens
- total-supply of the token
- balance of a particular account for the token

Structure of the above features can be taken from the etherscan frontend and you can do a
presentation according to it.
There also needs to be a connect wallet option where a user can connect their wallet (not
restricted to metamask) and on going the profile dashboard should be able to see their ether
balance, list of normal trxs and list of erc-20 tokens. Note: you won’t be able to find any design

inspiration for this on etherscan website as this is a way for us to check how well you are able to
create a customizable design system.
